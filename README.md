🎨 Computer Vision for Interactive Museum Displays

An interactive real-time computer vision system that recognizes artworks using ORB feature extraction and descriptor matching, enabling adaptive and touch-free digital exhibit experiences.

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how classical computer vision techniques can power interactive museum environments. The system detects and matches artworks in real time using feature extraction and similarity comparison, triggering dynamic digital responses based on visual recognition.

The solution is designed to simulate how modern museums can transition from static exhibits to immersive, AI-driven interactive displays.
